# Calculator App

Developed a simple arithmetic calculator with using  CSS grid, HTML, and JavaScript basics.

## Description

Anyone should be able to perform the four most common arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on this calculator app by constructing a valid expression using the input buttons, and have the result displayed on the screen. Allowing you to input decimals as well as reset/clear the calculator.

* Fixes the decimal bug so that if you enter a decimal point after clicking on an operator, it gets appended to the second operand instead of being a part of the first.
* Refactor event listener to make it easier to allow additonal operations
* Floating-pont precision accounted for and ensures that the number of digits after the decimal point is restricted to that value. The return value may be rounded or padded with zeros if necessary.
